# Test Plan â€“ QA Automation Project on automationintesting.online

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the testing strategy and scope for the site [https://automationintesting.online/](https://automationintesting.online/), a demo site designed for practicing software testing.

## 2. Test Objectives

- Ensure the functional quality and stability of key features.
- Validate user interfaces and interactions.
- Verify the correct operation of the exposed REST API.
- Ensure sufficient coverage of manual and automated tests.
- Detect and document defects.
- Enable regular execution of regression tests.

## 3. Test Scope

The tests will cover the following modules:

- Booking form
- Authentication and backoffice
- Room management (CRUD)
- REST API (bookings, users, rooms)
- Navigation and user interface (UI/UX)

## 4. Types of Tests

| Test Type               | Description                                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Functional Testing      | Manual and automated tests on key features     |
| API Testing             | Validation of API endpoints via Postman or scripts |
| UI Testing              | Automated user interface tests via Selenium/Cypress |
| Regression Testing      | Regular execution of automated tests to detect regressions |
| Performance Testing     | (Optional) Measuring response times             |
